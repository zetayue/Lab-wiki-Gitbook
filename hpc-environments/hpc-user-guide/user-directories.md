# User Directories

Each user will have two directories according to the userâ€™s account:

`/home/user_name` and `/raid/home/user_name`.

**To avoid the unnecessary consumption of OS storage, all users should only use**

`/raid/home/user_name` as their working directory.

{% hint style="info" %}
Files under `/home/user_name` consume the OS storage while files under `/raid/home/user_name` consume the external Data storage.
{% endhint %}
