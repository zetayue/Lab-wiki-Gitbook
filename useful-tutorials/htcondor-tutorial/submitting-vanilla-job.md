# Submitting Vanilla Job

## Introduction of Vanilla Universe

The vanilla universe in HTCondor is intended for most programs. Shell scripts are another case where the vanilla universe is useful.

Access to the jobâ€™s input and output files is a concern for vanilla universe jobs. One option is for HTCondor to rely on a shared file system, such as NFS or AFS. Alternatively, HTCondor has a mechanism for transferring files on behalf of the user. In this case, HTCondor will transfer any files needed by a job to the execution site, run the job, and transfer the output back to the submitting machine.

## Submit File for Vanilla Job

Here is an example submit description file for a sample job in a vanilla universe:

```text
universe                = vanilla
executable              = sub.sh
should_transfer_files   = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT

notify_user             = someaddress@mail.com
notification            = Complete

output                  = out.$(Cluster)
error                   = err.$(Cluster)
log                     = log.$(Cluster)

request_cpus            = 1
request_gpus            = 2
request_memory          = 3096
request_disk            = 10240

```

## Bash File for Vanilla Job

Here is a bash file to be executed for running`main.py`:

```text
#!/bin/bash

cd /raid/home/user_name/work_dir
python main.py
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note that it is mandatory to use`cd /raid/home/user_name/work_dir`before your executable commmands \(`/raid/home/user_name/work_dir`is your local working directory that stores `main.py`on DLS\).
{% endhint %}
